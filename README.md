# STARNAVI-test

This is a test task from the company StarNavi.

# This small application includes:

Integration and interaction with the backend via the link ( https://60816d9073292b0017cdd833.mockapi.io/modes )

In a selector with a dropdown list, you can choose the preferred number of squares that will appear when you press the start button.

When hovering over a blue square, it turns gray, and it also works the other way around - when hovering over a gray one, it turns blue.

The application is written in React.
